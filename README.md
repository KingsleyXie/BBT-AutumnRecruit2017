# BBT-AutumnRecruit2017
This is the Back-End code for BBT autumn recruit in 2017

**How to use**: Just use SQL code in `initDB.sql` to create the database, and change configuration part inside `config.php`, then the Back-End code works and you can dock it with Front-End code via the Docking Document.

***

Extra Information:

- Tag `v0.0.0` is a normal version which includes register module only
- Tag `v1.0.0` includes departments' data API module and game module(especially write this time as we prepared a game before register module)
- Tag `v1.1.0` includes some optimizations and enhancements since `v1.0.0`
- Tag `v1.1.3` is exactly what we use in the online version
- Tag `v1.2.0` contains export module so that you can directly get register data and statistics under `csv` format, and of course, **DO NOT DEPLOY THE EXPORT CODE ONLINE!**
